# Smart Parking
Objective of this Project was to Ô¨Ånd location of an empty Parking slot using a mobile application. Designed around embedded systems , it involved interface between Microcontrollers viz . **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** & **Atmega16A** and allowed for serial communication between them.

The Softwares Used were :
* #### [Atmel Studio 7.0](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/atmel-studio-7)
   The IDE used to program in Assembly and covert it to it's respective Hex files.
* #### [Burn-O-Mat](http://avr8-burn-o-mat.aaabbb.de/avr8_burn_o_mat_avrdude_gui_en.php)
    A GUI to burn Hex files onto the microcontroller which is less compliated to do as compared to AVRdudes.
* #### [AVRdudes](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)
    A CLI to burn Hex files and do other operations onto the microcontroller.
* #### [USBASP](https://www.fischl.de/usbasp/)
    USBasp is a USB in-circuit programmer for Atmel AVR controllers. It simply consists of an ATMega88 or an ATMega8 and a couple of passive components. The programmer uses a firmware-only USB driver, no special USB controller is needed.
    Download the respective drivers for it or it won't work !
